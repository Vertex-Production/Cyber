# Cyber Language
[Rus version](Readme%20ru.md)

Translation from Russian
**⚠️IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Cyber ​​language is currently under development and cannot be used for any purpose.⚠️

## Description

**Cyber** is a new programming language that combines many of the best practices and features from C++ and C#. It is designed to simplify development for programmers who want to use the functionality of C++, but with the clearer and simpler syntax of C#. Cyber ​​is translated into C++, allowing developers to leverage the power and performance of that language without sacrificing the usability and readability of their code.

## Peculiarities

- **Simple syntax**: Cyber ​​borrows many expressions and constructs from C#, making it more accessible to those already familiar with the language.

- **Object-oriented programming**: Support for classes, inheritance, interfaces, and polymorphism allows you to implement powerful and flexible data structures.

- **СTranspiler**: Cyber ​​automatically translates to efficient C++ code, allowing you to reap the performance benefits without having to manually optimize your code.

- **Simplified type checking**: Cyber ​​performs static type checking and supports modern programming practices, reducing the likelihood of errors.

- **C++ compatibility**: Code written in Cyber ​​can be easily integrated into existing C++ projects.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have a C++ compiler installed (e.g. g++, clang or MSVC).
2. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vertex-Production/Cyber.git
   ```

3. Go to the project directory:
